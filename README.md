- See hover states for interactive elements



### Links

- Solution URL: https://github.com/Fola-Joe/nft-preview-card-component-project.git

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned


I learned how flexbox works. Although it was very challenging for me as a newbie. I had issues with placing the view image over the nft-equilibrium image.

I came across a new css attribute especially to limit the background color
```css
.img {
  background-clip: border-box, content-box, margin-box;
}
```


<!-- If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. -->



### Continued development


I would like to work more on my knowledge on flexbox and probably learn and make use of css grid.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me to work on overlaying images.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to implement the position attribute in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
